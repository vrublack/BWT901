# BWT901
Community app for the BWT901CL-E Sensor (Wit Motion)

This is an app allowing you to record sensor data from the BWT901CL-E 9DOF Sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer). The sensor is manufactured by WitMotion and I used their code as a starting but but am in no way affiliated with them.

In particular, I made sure the app can record in the background for an extended period of time using a foreground service.

Tested under Google Pixel 2 with Android 10.
